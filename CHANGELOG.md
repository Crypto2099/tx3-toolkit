# Tx3 Toolkit — Changelog

## [1.0.2] — 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Startup crash** — `ClassCastException` when IntelliJ passes inlay hint
  `Settings` serialized by a previous classloader instance (e.g., after a plugin
  update or IDE restart without full reinstalling). The provider now falls back to
  default settings instead of crashing.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-22

- **Plugin ID rejected** — The plugin ID `io.txpipe.tx3.intellij` was rejected
  by the JetBrains Marketplace validator as it must not contain the word
  `intellij`. Renamed to `io.txpipe.tx3`.
- **`env` block parse error** — Fields inside `env { ... }` blocks were
  incorrectly flagged as errors due to a double-brace consumption bug introduced
  during the `parseRecordFieldBlock` refactor. The opening `{` was being
  consumed twice, causing the first field name to be parsed as an unexpected
  token.
- **Builtin type highlighting lost** — `Int`, `Bytes`, `Bool` and other builtin
  types were losing their syntax highlighting inside `type` and `record`
  declarations. The annotator's semantic pass was overriding lexer-level token
  colors without re-applying them on `TypeRef` nodes.
- **Update plugin icon** — The plugin icon was updated to match the branding
  guidelines from JetBrains to ensure it appears consistently on the marketplace
  and in the plugin manager.
